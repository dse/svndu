# svndu

Converts the output of `svn ls -vR` into `du`-compatible output

## Why did I write this utility?

Primarily for analyzing the disk usage of a *remote* Subversion
repository without checking out a local copy of it.

## Why did I write this utility to output in `du` format?

Primarily to use with [tdu](http://webonastick.com/tdu/).

## Oh the irony of hosting the source code of a utility that works
   with Subversion repositories in GitHub.

It's not lost on me.
